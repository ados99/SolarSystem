This is a simple model of the solar system. It includes a rotate planets feature as well as a captions feature.

This was written in CSS, HTML, and JQuery. The JQuery was used to display the captions on hover as well as account
for starting/stopping the animation.

Some additions in the future include having a link for each planet for more info, as well as making the captions not
rotate with the planets.

To view this app, simply clone this repo in your file system and open the html page.
